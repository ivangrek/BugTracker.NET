      Set WindowsAuthentication to "Windows" if you want to use windows authentication instead of the logon page.

      1) Configure your IIS virtual directory so that anon access is unchecked and windows authentication is checked
      2) Configure IE to automatically send username and password
      3) Usernames in users table should match your windows usernames. Passwords in users table will be ignored.

      If you want BOTH modes to work, set "WindowsAuthentication" to "Both".

      Configure your IIS virtual directory as normal (allowing anon access). Follow these instructions for the file "Account/LoginNt":

      * From IIS Manager, right-click the file Account/LoginNt and select properties
      * Select the Security tab
      * Click Edit in the Anonymous Access and Authentication frame
      * Ensure Anonymous Access and Basic Authentication is cleared
      * Ensure Integrated Windows Authentication is selected
      * Click OK
      * Select the Custom Errors tab
      * Select HTTP Error 401;2 and click Edit Properties
      * Set the message type to File and select the file login.htm, including the full local path. (Note that this must be a file reference and not a URL)

      The idea is that when the user access Account/Login, it redirects to Account/LoginNt.
      When access to Account/LoginNt is denied, IIS responds with the custom error login.htm.
      Login.htm then redirects to Account/Login.
